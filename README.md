# GOLD-PRICE-PREDICTION
This project is undertaken using various financial features such as the S&P 500 index (SPX), Gold ETF (GLD), US Oil Fund (USO), Silver ETF (SLV), and the Euro to USD exchange rate (EUR/USD). The data preprocessing steps involve loading the dataset, exploring its characteristics, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and detecting outliers through boxplots. Outliers are then removed for 'GLD,' 'USO,' and 'SLV' features. The correlation matrix is calculated to understand the relationships between the features. Distribution histograms are plotted to visualize the data. Subsequently, the dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training. The code employs three different regression models â€“ Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV for each model to find the optimal parameters. The results provide insights into the best-performing models based on cross-validated scores. The analysis is comprehensive, covering data preprocessing, outlier handling, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning for accurate gold price prediction.
